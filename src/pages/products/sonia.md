## Organisation-wide Internship and Field Placement Tracking

Sonia provides a rock solid foundation to support internships and field placements (or work experience, cooperative education, field education) throughout your organisation. From the largest faculties placing thousands of students per year through to small schools that wish to record student-initiated placements, Sonia handles them all.  We know that every area of your organisation has its own terminology and placement rules - Sonia has the flexibility to handle them all.

## Sonia Can Help Busy Placement Staff

Sonia helps your team stay on top of placements and keep the stress level down.  Your students will use Sonia to keep track of their placements, prerequisites and preferences - meaning fewer emails and phone calls.

Sonia helps you manage the organisations you deal with. Your relationship with an organisation is more than a name and address. You want to make sure that the placement providers and your students enjoy a really great placement experience. Students will be prepared with the right information and venues will be kept up to date with tailored emails, web site and printed information.
Standard reports and flexible exports make it easy to satisfy requests for placement data and statistics.

## Site Management

Sonia is a fantastic choice for universities looking for an organisation-wide placement solution. While schools can keep and control their own terminology and business rules, Sonia allows placement providers (sites) to be shared across the organisation.

Potential placement providers can use the Sonia web site to nominate themselves and provide the initial contact information.
These new venues can be tracked and processed in Sonia and eventually turned into qualified placement providers.

Only Sonia gives this flexibility plus the power to manage thousands of student placements simultaneously.
